# Meta CentraLand

This project simulates a Meta Centra-Land environment where users can purchase, play and manage virtual spaces.

## requirements
You need to open 2 terminals, 1 to the frontend and the other to the backend.
In addition, you have to install MongoDB on your machine.

## npm install
run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## How to run this project?
1.  In the first terminal type `npm run server`. the backend will start at port 5000.
2.  In the second terminal type `npm start`. the frontend will start an available port.

The website should open automatically, if not, open the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (change the port if needed).

## Important!
**At the first launch of the program, an admin must be created when his full name is admin (lowercase) and his job title is a buyer.**
The program will automatically create the land from the file landsDB.json. At the end of the process, a message will appear on the screen to continue as usual (create additional users or log in Meta Central Land)
